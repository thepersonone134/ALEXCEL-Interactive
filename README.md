**thepersonone134's A-Level Excel Interactive (User Interface)**

This program written completely in Python automates many of the filtering, searching and file naming conventions of my A-Level spreadsheet and its related storage system.
My A-Level spreadsheet and the naming system (Unique File Identification) has been attached with this repo to provide context.

## Guidance with running the program
To run this program you will need to have the dependencies `pandas` and `openpyxl` installed on your device- as they are required for reading/ writing/ opening the excel sheet.
To run the program, run `File Manager.py` under `File Management`.
