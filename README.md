**thepersonone134's A-Level Excel Interactive (User Interface)**

This program written completely in Python automates many of the filtering, searching and file naming conventions of my A-Level spreadsheet and its related storage system.
My A-Level spreadsheet and the naming system (Unique File Identification) has been attached with this repo to provide context.
